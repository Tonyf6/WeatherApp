Challenge  - Weather App
Starting a new project where we are given a Figma Template and we are using an API to fetch weather data, as well as using HTML, CSS & JS to build a functional 5-day Weather Forecast.
Person who Peer Reviewed me was Alejandro De La Cruz-Rubio! 
Peer Review Comment: Code looks good and is straight forward to read. Am able to understand what works as what. Design is very accurate to figma design.-->
